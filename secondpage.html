    <h1>Graph of generisty versus happiness</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Looking at the data, it seems as though happiness and generosity do not corerlate. Being geneorus or not 
      has nothing to do with happiness, The data shows that people that are in the positive and negative of the
      genersoity scale can be equally happy and unhappy</p>
